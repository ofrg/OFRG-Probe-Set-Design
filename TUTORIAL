Tutorial for using the OFRG Probe Set Design processing pipeline.


In order to make the tutorial as short as possible, the folder "a_maskedfastas"
has be preloaded with a few fasta files from RDP.  This permits us to skip the
first script (a_rdp_downloader.pl), which takes a long time to run.

Be sure to look at the README file for important installation requirements.

All scripts from b to i will use the file "probeset.conf" for information about
which directories they should use to load and/or save data, among other things.
The default values are fine for this tutorial, and running it is quite simple
once everything has been installed properly. Notes about the a_rdp_downloader.pl
script are at the end of this tutorial.


1) Starting with the second script, run it by typing, "perl b_remove_variable_regions.pl"
   at the command prompt.

   When it is finished you will notice a new directory has been created, called,
   "b_varregionsremoved". Several other scripts will also create new directories.

2) Optionally, run the next script, "bb_remove_common_gaps.pl" in a similar manner.
   Running this script will speed up the creation of distance matrices later.

3) Run "c_remove_duplicate_sequences.pl".  You will see a new directory named,
   "c_nodupe", and the number of duplicates found in each file is displayed onscreen.

4) Run "d_column_distance.pl". One file in the tutorial is much larger than the
   others and it will take much longer to make the distance matrix for it. 

   In the probeset.conf file, the "maxsize" parameter in the [column_distance]
   section determines which files are processed and which are skipped. The default
   size is 6000000 bytes. All files larger than this are skipped.  The names
   of the skipped files are saved to "large_files_skiped_by_column_distance.txt".

   When necessary, large files can be broken into smaller jobs by using the
   "db_column_distance_qsub.pl" script. See the comments at the beginning of
   this file for instructions on how to use it. It is not necessary for this tutorial.

   If "db_column_distance_qsub.pl" is used you must also run
   "dc1_column_distance_merge.pl" to merge the partial distance matrix files created
   by "the "db_column_distance_qsub.pl" script. An alternative version of the "dc1"
   script is included ("dc2_column_distance_merge.pl") which performs the same
   task but uses less RAM. It is not as well tested, however, so use with caution.

5) Run "dd_column_distance_sort.pl". This script sorts all the distance matrices
   so that the mothur program can operate more quickly.

6) Run "e_makenamefiles.pl". This makes "namefiles" which are required for mothur.

7) Run "f_makeotus.pl", which uses mothur to create OTUs.

8) Run "g_training_seqs_maker.pl". This creates the training sequences file.

9) Run "h_sequences2matrix_by_otu.pl". Enter "500" when prompted by the script, then
   hit the return key. You will be again be prompted with the same question. This
   time, enter "q" and hit the return key to continue.

   The script will create a matrix file containing 500 of the most conserved
   probes found in the sequences of the training sequences file.

10) Run "i_makeprobes.pl".  One probe set will be created and placed in the
   "i_probes" directory.

   Note that if you chose a different number of probes in step 9) you will
   need to change the filename for the input_matrix_file parameter to match it.
   See the [makeprobes] section of the probeset.conf file.

Other parameters exist and can be changed in the probeset.conf file, including
many that are specific to the probe set design program itself.  Most of these are
self explanatory or are described at the bottom of the configuration file or
have been discussed in the paper.


Running the a_rdp_downloader.pl script.

This script uses the file "rdp_downloader.conf" and must be run on a Windows machine,
as it uses a special Perl module and AutoIt to control the IE browser. See the
README file for instructions on how to install these and other requirements.

IMPORTANT: Before running this script you must open an account at the RDP website,
           here: https://rdp.cme.msu.edu/user/createAcct.spr

           You must add your username and password to the "rdp_downloader.conf"
           file or the script will not be allowed to download the "mask" sequences
           that are necessary for removing the variable regions in the sequences.

           Make sure you have replaced the original WinClicker.pm module in the
           directory where Win32::IEAutomation was installed with the version that 
           came with this software, as it provides additional (and required)
           functionality.

           It will be necessary to use a computer dedicated to running this script
           (while the script is running). Trying to use the computer for other 
           tasks will inevitably cause the script to crash and/or make errors in
           naming files for saving. Do not do this. Test it out to make sure it
           runs okay, then stop the script and restart it before you leave work.
           RDP doesn't really like an automated script putting a load on their servers, 
           so doing it at night when fewer pages are being requested is a nice thing
           to do anyway.

This script may take 12 hours or more to download the files from the RDP website.
Unfortunately, at the time of this writing, RDP does not provide an easy way to 
download sequences on a per genus basis, necessitating the use of this script.

If something goes wrong during the downloading of files the script will probably
crash. Note the last (or second to last) Phylum and Genus that was downloaded.
Add these to the "rdp_downloader.conf" file for the startphylum and startgenus
values.  Change the startatfirstphylum=T to startatfirstphylum=F and restart the
a_rdp_downloader.pl script.
